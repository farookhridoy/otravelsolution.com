      When making any Account Booking, the Customer must quote its Customer

      in the same manner and at the same time as set out in clauses 2.1.4 and

      be calculated on the journey specified by the Customer at the time of
      Booking (the “Quoted Journey”). The price quoted by us shall be based
      upon our chosen route between the Collection Address and the Destination
      Address (via any other pick-up points or drop-off points stated by the

      have been agreed by ULKA for Account Bookings, the price quoted for

      distance of less than 10 miles in any 1 hour period of hire; and (iii)
      has a minimum of 3 stops in the period of hire, where the Customer or any

      flight respectively. We reserve the right to charge the Customer a
      Waiting Time Charge which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the
      first 15 or 30 minutes (as the case may be) waiting time. For the

      the collection time accordingly; or (ii) if the Customer does not provide
      a flight number, the time which has been specified by the Customer for
      the Airport Booking. For all Airport Bookings other than on-demand
      Airport Bookings, the Customer may specify a collection time at any time
      after the flight arrival time, after which specified time the 15 or 30
      minutes (as the case may be) waiting time shall commence. After expiry of

     implied by common law or under statute in relation to the subject matter
     of any Contract and that it shall have no rights or remedies with respect
     to such subject matter otherwise than under the relevant Contract.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.4
     We shall be entitled to vary the Price List from time to time.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.5
     We shall be entitled to exercise a lien over any Goods or property
     belonging to any Passenger until we receive full payment of any Charges
     due to us.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.6
     We may, in our absolute discretion, decline to accept any Booking.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.7
     Any dates, periods or times specified by us in connection with the
     performance of the Services are estimates only and time shall not be of
     the essence for the performance by us of our obligations under the
     Contract. We make no warranty that any Passenger or Goods or property
     shall be delivered within the Customer’s stipulated time period (if any)
     and/or within any time period stated by us unless express reference is
     made to this clause 5.7 and agreed in writing by a director of ULKA.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.8
     Passenger(s) and any luggage and bicycle and any personal items and all
     Goods shall be ready for collection at the time stipulated by the Customer
     when the Booking is made. Where the Collection Address is in a Restricted
     Street we will allow 2 minutes for loading. In respect of Restricted
     Street collections only, and in the event that all booked Passenger(s),
     and their luggage, have not boarded the Passenger Vehicle and all Goods
     have not been loaded on to the Courier Vehicle as the case may be within 2
     minutes of the later of: (i) the arrival of the Passenger Vehicle or
     Courier Services vehicle at the Collection Address; and (ii) the booked
     time for collection, we reserve the right to charge the Customer a Waiting
     Time Charge which will, for the avoidance of doubt, not include the first
     2 minutes). Furthermore where the Collection Address is in a Restricted
     Street the Driver shall be entitled to leave the Collection Address and we
     shall endeavour to arrange with the Customer a revised collection time or
     location. If revised collection details cannot be agreed with the Customer
     we may treat the Booking as having been cancelled and charge a
     Cancellation Fee. In respect of Courier Services only where neither the
     Collection Address nor Destination Address is a Restricted Street, we will
     allow 5 minutes for loading at the Collection Address and 5 minutes for
     unloading at the Destination Address, making an aggregate of 10 minutes,
     based on: (i) the later of the arrival of the Courier Services vehicle at
     the Collection Address; or the booked time for collection; and (ii) the
     arrival time at the Destination Address Where all Goods are not loaded at
     the Collection Address and unloaded at the Destination Address within the
     aggregate of 10 minutes as set out in this clause 5.8 above, we reserve
     the right to charge the Customer a Waiting Time Charge, which will, for
     the avoidance of doubt, commence after the expiry of the abovementioned
     aggregate of 10 minutes.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.9
     No delay or omission by either party in exercising in whole or in part any
     right, power or remedy provided by law or under the Contract shall affect
     that right, power or remedy; or operate as a waiver of it.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.10
     The Customer agrees to indemnify and keep us fully indemnified from and
     against any direct and indirect losses, claims, expenses, damages or

      for the repair or replacement of the Goods up to a greater value and the
      Customer shall indemnify us against any Passenger claiming sums in excess
      of such limits.<o:p></o:p></li>
 </ul>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.13
     To the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable in any way
     whatsoever for the acts or omissions of any sub-contractors to whom we

     ensure that we only sub-contract the Services to such third parties that
     have at least the minimum insurance cover required in the third party’s
     country of operation. If we are aware that a third party does not have a
     level of insurance coverage which we would expect, we reserve the right to
     request that the Customer signs a standard form disclaimer and
     acknowledgement in respect of the same.<o:p></o:p></li>

     beyond our reasonable control.<o:p></o:p></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">5.18
     In relation to Network Bookings, we shall to the extent permitted by law,

     To allow us to provide the Customer with the best possible service, we may
     use location-based services. Information that we collect from the Customer
     through the use of these services shall be collected and stored in
     accordance with the terms of our privacy policy. By accepting these Terms
     the Customer consents to our use of location-based services. The Customer
     can withdraw its consent at any time. The accuracy of our location-based
     services may vary depending on the Customer’s location and whether the
     Customer is in a rural or urban environment. We reserve the right to
     suspend or terminate the location based services at any time. In providing
     active location-based services we comply with the “Industry Code of
     Practice for use of Mobile Phone Technology to Provide Passive Services to
     the UK” (which sets principles of good practice for the provision of
     passive and active location based services), a copy of which can be found

     and by registered post shall be deemed served forty eight (48) hours after
     posting to an address in the United Kingdom or five (5) Business Days
     after posting to an address outside the United Kingdom. In proving the
     service of any notice it will be sufficient to prove, in the case of a
     registered post letter to provide proof of delivery.<o:p></o:p></li>
